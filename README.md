##Quick instructions for how to set up the development environment

1. Clone repo and cd into directory
2. ```cd src ```
3. install dependencies: ```npm install```
4. type ```lite-server``` while inside src directory (you probably should install lite-server globally. Type npm install -g lite-server)

####Small issues

- gulp build process not completely set up currently but this is not necessary for development
